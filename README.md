Project Name: ImageMatchAI

ImageMatchAI is a web-based application that allows users to upload an image and find visually similar images from a dataset. It leverages computer vision and deep learning techniques to extract image features and compare them efficiently. The backend is built using Flask, and the image processing is done using libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras, or FAISS for fast similarity search.

Technologies Used:
1. Backend (Flask for API & Web Server)
Flask: To handle HTTP requests and serve the web interface.
Flask-RESTful: For building REST APIs.
2. Image Processing & Feature Extraction
OpenCV: For image pre-processing.
TensorFlow/Keras: For deep learning-based feature extraction.
Scikit-learn: For dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA).
3. Similarity Search
FAISS: Fast similarity search for large datasets.
Scipy: For distance calculations (e.g., cosine similarity, Euclidean distance).
4. Frontend (Optional)
HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Flask templates) for a simple UI.
How It Works:
User Uploads an Image â†’ The Flask app receives the image.
Feature Extraction â†’ The image is converted into a feature vector using a pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet, VGG16).
Similarity Search â†’ The extracted feature vector is compared with a database of stored images.
Results Displayed â†’ The most similar images are returned and displayed to the user.
Possible Enhancements:
âœ… Use a pre-trained deep learning model for better accuracy.
âœ… Store image features in a database (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQLite) or FAISS index.
âœ… Deploy using Docker and NGINX for scalability.
